# Logging
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/), by providing a
# logger.xml file in the conf directory .

# Using logger.xml, instead of this simplified logging, to get SQL statement
# logging. See http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0/SettingsLogger
# and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9371907/
