# PasswordThing

*PasswordThing* is a simple Scala [Play][] application that provides a
safe place to store passwords. It's intended primarily as demoware and
accompanies the presentation on Play that I gave to a joint meeting of
the Philadelphia Java User's Group ([PhillyJUG][]) and the Philly Area
Scala Enthusiasts ([PHASE][]) on 2 October, 2012.
